# Molecule-Drawer
Code to (and related to) draw molecules/save the output to a file!

# Molecule Drawer.py
This code takes a str input (Such as 'Methane','Methene','Methanol' or 'Methylmethanoate') and prints out the molecule to the screen.

# Intended changes
1.) A proof-of-concept to show how we'll save the output to a file

2.) Updating the code to draw Carboxylic Acids

3.) Combining the two so that Sorrybot (repository on the way) is able to output them
